# AWS-multi-region-failover-API-terraform-deployment
This project demonstrates the setup of a fault-tolerant, multi-region RESTful API system using AWS services. The architecture ensures high availability, disaster recovery, and seamless failover between regions. It is ideal for use cases requiring low-latency global access to weather data or other critical services.
