boto3==1.28.57  # AWS SDK for Python to interact with DynamoDB and other AWS services


This is the official AWS SDK for Python, required for interacting with AWS services like DynamoDB, Lambda, and others.

The version 1.28.57 is an example; you can specify the latest compatible version or let it default to the latest by omitting the version number.

Notes:
If you later extend the Lambda function to include additional libraries (e.g., for data parsing or more complex operations), you can add them to this file.
To install these dependencies locally for testing you can run the bash code:

pip install -r requirements.txt


When deploying this Lambda function, ensure the dependencies are packaged correctly (e.g., using a deployment script or a Lambda layer).
